## App Functionality
The application accepts some user information like the Email Firstname LAstname and Password. 
The Application checks If the the users input conforms with the Validation Schema. If it does not, it will
show an Error just below the input tag.

The Application has 3 buttons, Which are displayed logocally. The Next button is shown on the first page while the Previous and Submit Button are shown on the Second page.

If the submit button is press and all the informationm is filled in, the application makes a POST request to the BE.

The BE sanitize user input and removes noises again to check if it conforms with the validation schema designed in the code.
It checks if email is already existing, and sends a Notifcation to FE accordingly

A notification pane is shown displaying a success message or a failure message according to what is returned from the BE.

The application then makes a GET request, if the POST request is successfull or the user information has been saved in the DB.

If the GET request is successfull it will then display the Users information with the success message.
